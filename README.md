# Meck AI Assistant

A real-time multilingual AI voice assistant inspired by Jarvis, built using Python, Groq AI, Faster-Whisper, and Edge-TTS.

Meck AI can:
- Understand voice commands
- Speak English, Malayalam, and Manglish
- Maintain conversation memory
- Support wake-word activation
- Interrupt responses in real time
- Enter idle mode automatically
- Run on low-end hardware

# Why I Built This

I built Meck AI because I wanted to create my own real-time AI voice assistant inspired by Jarvis.

I was interested in combining:
- speech recognition
- conversational AI
- multilingual interaction
- realistic voice synthesis

into a single lightweight assistant.

Another goal was making the assistant work on low-end hardware while still providing fast AI responses using cloud-based inference.

I also wanted to support Malayalam and Manglish conversations because most voice assistants do not properly support regional language interaction.

# Challenges Faced

Some challenges while building this project included:

- Reducing AI response delay
- Handling microphone background noise
- Preventing false detections
- Supporting Malayalam and Manglish speech
- Managing real-time interruption while speaking
- Creating smooth wake-word activation
- Running efficiently on low-end hardware

# What I Learned

During this project I learned how to:

- Use Groq AI APIs
- Implement speech-to-text systems
- Generate realistic AI voice responses
- Process microphone audio in real time
- Build multilingual conversational systems
- Handle audio playback and interruption
- Use multithreading in Python
